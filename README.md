# climate-crop-analyzer

Creating a complete Python program for a climate-crop analyzer involves several key components:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Collect climate and crop yield data. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume you have CSV files with climate and crop yield information.
  
2. **Data Analysis and Model Building**: Use machine learning to analyze the data and create a predictive model.

3. **Prediction and Optimization**: Use the model to predict crop yields and optimize farming conditions.

4. **Error Handling**: Incorporate error handling to manage any issues that arise with data input, processing, or modeling.

Below is a simple example of such a program using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(levelname)s: %(message)s')

def load_data(climate_data_path, yield_data_path):
    """
    Load climate and crop yield data from CSV files.
    """
    try:
        climate_data = pd.read_csv(climate_data_path)
        yield_data = pd.read_csv(yield_data_path)
        logging.info("Data loaded successfully.")
        return climate_data, yield_data
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error loading data: {e}")
        raise

def preprocess_data(climate_data, yield_data):
    """
    Preprocess the data for analysis.
    """
    try:
        # Assuming climate and yield data can be merged on a common 'year' column
        combined_data = pd.merge(climate_data, yield_data, on='year')
        features = combined_data.drop('yield', axis=1)  # drop yield for features
        target = combined_data['yield']
        logging.info("Data preprocessing successful.")
        return features, target
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error during data preprocessing: {e}")
        raise

def train_model(features, target):
    """
    Train a machine learning model to predict crop yield.
    """
    try:
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
        model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        logging.info("Model training completed.")
        
        # Evaluate the model
        predictions = model.predict(X_test)
        mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
        logging.info(f"Model Mean Squared Error: {mse:.2f}")
        
        return model
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error during model training: {e}")
        raise

def optimize_crop_yield(model, new_conditions):
    """
    Use the model to predict and optimize crop yield based on new farming conditions.
    """
    try:
        predicted_yield = model.predict(new_conditions)
        logging.info("Crop yield prediction completed.")
        return predicted_yield
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error during yield prediction: {e}")
        raise

def main():
    # Paths to the data files
    climate_data_path = 'climate_data.csv'
    yield_data_path = 'yield_data.csv'
    
    # Load and preprocess data
    climate_data, yield_data = load_data(climate_data_path, yield_data_path)
    features, target = preprocess_data(climate_data, yield_data)
    
    # Train the model
    model = train_model(features, target)
    
    # New farming conditions data for prediction (as an example)
    # Must be in the same format as the training features
    new_conditions = pd.DataFrame({
        'temperature': [22, 23],
        'rainfall': [100, 150],
        'humidity': [30, 40],
        # Add other columns as per your data structure
    })
    
    # Predict
    predicted_yields = optimize_crop_yield(model, new_conditions)
    for i, yield_value in enumerate(predicted_yields):
        logging.info(f"Predicted crop yield for condition set {i+1}: {yield_value:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Components and Considerations:

1. **Data Handling**: Load and preprocess the data while ensuring appropriate error handling.

2. **Model Training**: Use a `RandomForestRegressor` to train a model on the data. Options like hyperparameter tuning could also be explored for better performance.

3. **Prediction**: Input new farming conditions into the model to predict yields. Ensure that input data for predictions has the same features as the model expects.

4. **Logging**: Useful for monitoring the flow of the application and debugging.

Before running the script, make sure the climate and yield data files (`climate_data.csv` and `yield_data.csv`) are available and formatted correctly with appropriate columns. Adjust the column names in `new_conditions` to match your dataset. This script is a simple framework that can be expanded with more sophisticated data handling, model evaluation, and optimization techniques.
